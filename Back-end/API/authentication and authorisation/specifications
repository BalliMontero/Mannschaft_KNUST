OVERVIEW
- all authentication activity has to be done on the server side
- the client will send me credentials in JSON format and i will compare them with values in the database

METHODOLOGY
- i will store a crypt of the credentials in the database and test submitted credentials

-----------------
|   sign in     |
-----------------
- client submits credentials in plain text JSON format
- i then subject the credentials to the crypt algorithm and compare with database records
- return a status message based on whether authentication was successful or not
- if successful, proceed to grant access to services

-----------------
|   sign up     |
-----------------
- client submits credentials in plain text JSON format
- i then subject the credentials to the crypt function
- store the credentials along with the crypt
- return status message based on whether sign up success successful or not

ADVANCED
- provide the client with session key to grant access as long as key is valid; if invalid/expired, disconnect
- i will check for malformed input when signing up to protect database from attacks [client side should also be able to perform such validatory activities as well]
